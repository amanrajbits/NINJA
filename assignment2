View detected devices of class "DISK"

lshw -C disk

	View existing partition table(s)

fdisk -l
	Edit the partition table for my chosen device (in this case, "sdx")

fdisk /dev/sdx

	Within FDISK, press:

		d ...to delete the current partition

		n ...to create a new partition

		p ...to specify it as a PRIMARY partition

		1 ...to set it as the 1ST primary partition

		w ...to write the changes.

Display the new partition table:

fdisk -l

Format the new partition's filesystem as type ext4

	mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdx1

Create a new directory where the new drive will mount into:

mkdir /storage
mount /dev/sdx1 /storage
